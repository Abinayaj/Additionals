Dear Naren,

I am willing to have a quick note to thank you for the oppportunity to attend the training session "soft skills Training".The training was very helpful in terms of many aspects.Have to see how well what I learnt will transfer back to the job, and I'm confident the training provided me with a lot of insight and necessary tools. Without your support, I would not have been able to attend the session.

I would personally thank Lalitha and Udhay for co-ordinating with us and making weekend as useful.

Thanks,
Abinaya
